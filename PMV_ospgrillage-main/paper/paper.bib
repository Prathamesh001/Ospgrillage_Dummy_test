    abstract = {OpenSees, an open source finite element software framework, has been used broadly in the earthquake engineering community for simulating the seismic response of structural and geotechnical systems. The framework allows users to perform finite element analysis with a scripting language and for developers to create both serial and parallel finite element computer applications as interpreters. For the last 15 years, Tcl has been the primary scripting language to which the model building and analysis modules of OpenSees are linked. To provide users with different scripting language options, particularly Python, the OpenSees interpreter interface was refactored to provide multi-interpreter capabilities. This refactoring, resulting in the creation of OpenSeesPy as a Python module, is accomplished through an abstract interface for interpreter calls with concrete implementations for different scripting languages. Through this approach, users are able to develop applications that utilize the unique features of several scripting languages while taking advantage of advanced finite element analysis models and algorithms.}

    abstract = {This chapter is concerned with the static and vibration analysis of orthogonal and skew grillages, and a number of such structures are analyzed by computer in the chapter. Grillages or grids are often used to cover wide areas, where the supports can, in general, only be placed around the periphery of the structure and at a few other discrete points. The stiffening effect of cross-members is used to strengthen the structure so that the lateral loads can be resisted in bending and torsion by the members of the grid in both directions. Gillage structures are of much interest in many branches of engineering, including the aircraft, shipbuilding, and the mechanical and civil engineering industries. These structures take many various forms, including hatch covers, decks, platforms, floors, etc. Much of the work that has been done on grillage structures has been based on analytical techniques and these theories have usually considered the static analysis of orthogonally stiffened rectangular grillages under uniform pressure. Whereas these theories are very useful for a large number of problems, they break down for gillages of complex shape with complex boundary conditions and load, and where the members of the grillage are made from different sections.}
